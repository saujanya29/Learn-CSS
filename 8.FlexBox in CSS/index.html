  /* FLexBox In CSS : 

  
  
--> First Make Display :flex;
1.Flex-direction: 
                 1.row  -> it will flex the items in horizontal direction 
                 2.col  ->it will flex the items in Vertical  direction 
                 3.row-reverse -> it will flex the items in reverse horizontal direction
                 4.col-reverse  -> it will flex the items in reverse Vertical direction
  
2.justify-content : justifly content will work in horizontal dir when flex dir is row or row-reverse
                    justifly content will work in Vertical dir when flex dir is col or col-reverse

    Properties:  1.start
                 2.end
                 3.center
                 4.space-around : In this there is equal space on the both sides of each flex items
                 5.space-between :first and last flex item will have no space at their end and other itme will have space
                 6.space-evenly: here even means equal space will be betweenn the all the flex items
  
 3. align-items: This will work same as the justify content but in opposite dir
                
 --> align-items will work in Vertical dir (cross -axis )when flex dir is row or row-reverse
 -->align-items will work in Horizontal dir (Main-axis )when flex dir is col or col-reverse
  

 4.align-content: 1.This aligns a flex containerâ€™s lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis, 
                  2.The CSS align-content property sets the distribution of space between and around content items along a flexbox's cross-axis

 5.align-self : The align-self CSS property overrides a grid or flex item's align-items value
  
6.flex-items: Properties for the children
 
            1.Order: decides in which order they will appear
            2.flex-grow: it will decide the speed at which flex item expand 
            (if flex-grow set to 1, the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all children)
            3.flex-shrink: it will decide the speed at which flex item shrink
            4.flex-basis:The flex-basis property specifies the initial length of a flexible item.
